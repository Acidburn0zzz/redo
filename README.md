# redo - a recursive build system

Smaller, easier, more powerful, and more reliable than `make`.

This is an implementation of [Daniel J. Bernstein's redo
build system](http://cr.yp.to/redo.html).  He never released his
version, so other people have implemented different variants based on his
published specification.

This version, sometimes called apenwarr/redo, is probably the most advanced
one, including support for parallel builds, improved logging, and helpful
debugging features.
