# redo: a recursive, general-purpose build system

`redo` is a competitor to the long-lived, but sadly imperfect, `make`
program.  There are many such competitors, because many people over the
years have been dissatisfied with make's limitations.  However, of all the
replacements I've seen, only redo captures the essential simplicity and
flexibility of make, while avoiding its flaws.  To my great surprise, it
manages to do this while being simultaneously simpler than make, more
flexible than make, and more powerful than make.

Although I wrote redo and I would love to take credit for it, the magical
simplicity and flexibility comes because I copied verbatim a design by
Daniel J. Bernstein (creator of qmail and djbdns, among many other useful
things).  He posted some very terse notes on his web site at one point
(there is no date) with the unassuming title, "[Rebuilding target files when
source files have changed](http://cr.yp.to/redo.html)." Those notes are
enough information to understand how the system is supposed to work;
unfortunately there's no code to go with it.  I get the impression that the
hypothetical "djb redo" is incomplete and Bernstein doesn't yet consider it
ready for the real world.

I was led to that particular page by random chance from a link on [The djb
way](http://thedjbway.b0llix.net/future.html), by Wayne Marshall.

After I found out about djb redo, I searched the Internet for any sign that
other people had discovered what I had: a hidden, unimplemented gem of
brilliant code design.  I found only one interesting link: Alan Grosskurth,
whose [Master's thesis at the University of Waterloo](http://grosskurth.ca/papers/mmath-thesis.pdf)
was about top-down software rebuilding, that is, djb redo.  He wrote his
own (admittedly slow) implementation in about 250 lines of shell script.

If you've ever thought about rewriting GNU make from scratch, the idea of
doing it in 250 lines of shell script probably didn't occur to you.  redo is
so simple that it's actually possible.  For testing, I actually wrote an
even more minimal version, which always rebuilds everything instead of
checking dependencies, in 210 lines of shell (about 4 kbytes).

The design is simply that good.

My implementation of redo is called `redo` for the same reason that there
are 75 different versions of `make` that are all called `make`.  It's somehow
easier that way.  Hopefully it will turn out to be compatible with the other
implementations, should there be any.

My extremely minimal implementation, called `do`, is in the `minimal/`
directory of this repository.

# What's so special about redo?

The theory behind redo is almost magical: it can do everything `make` can
do, only the implementation is vastly simpler, the syntax is cleaner, and you
can do even more flexible things without resorting to ugly hacks.  Also, you
get all the speed of non-recursive `make` (only check dependencies once per
run) combined with all the cleanliness of recursive `make` (you don't have
code from one module stomping on code from another module).

(Disclaimer: my current implementation is not as fast as `make` for some
things, because it's written in python.  Eventually I'll rewrite it an C and
it'll be very, very fast.)

The easiest way to show it is with an example.

Create a file called default.o.do:

	redo-ifchange $2.c
	gcc -MD -MF $2.d -c -o $3 $2.c
	read DEPS <$2.d
	redo-ifchange ${DEPS#*:}

Create a file called myprog.do:

	DEPS="a.o b.o"
	redo-ifchange $DEPS
	gcc -o $3 $DEPS
	
Of course, you'll also have to create `a.c` and `b.c`, the C language
source files that you want to build to create your application.

In a.c:

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include "b.h"
	
	int main() { printf(bstr); }
	
In b.h:

	extern char *bstr;
	
In b.c:

	char *bstr = "hello, world!\n";

Now you simply run:

	$ redo myprog
	
And it says:

	redo  myprog
	redo    a.o
	redo    b.o

Now try this:

	$ touch b.h
	$ redo myprog
	
Sure enough, it says:

	redo  myprog
	redo    a.o

Did you catch the shell incantation in `default.o.do` where it generates
the autodependencies?  The filename `default.o.do` means "run this script to
generate a .o file unless there's a more specific whatever.o.do script that
applies."

The key thing to understand about redo is that declaring a dependency is just
another shell command.  The `redo-ifchange` command means, "build each of my
arguments.  If any of them or their dependencies ever change, then I need to
run the *current script* over again."

Dependencies are tracked in a persistent `.redo` database so that redo can
check them later.  If a file needs to be rebuilt, it re-executes the
`whatever.do` script and regenerates the dependencies.  If a file doesn't
need to be rebuilt, redo can calculate that just using its persistent
`.redo` database, without re-running the script.  And it can do that check
just once right at the start of your project build.

But best of all, as you can see in `default.o.do`, you can declare a
dependency *after* building the program.  In C, you get your best dependency
information by trying to actually build, since that's how you find out which
headers you need.  redo is based on the following simple insight:
you don't actually
care what the dependencies are *before* you build the target; if the target
doesn't exist, you obviously need to build it.  Then, the build script
itself can provide the dependency information however it wants; unlike in
`make`, you don't need a special dependency syntax at all.  You can even
declare some of your dependencies after building, which makes C-style
autodependencies much simpler.

(GNU make supports putting some of your dependencies in include files, and
auto-reloading those include files if they change.  But this is very
confusing - the program flow through a Makefile is hard to trace already,
and even harder if it restarts randomly from the beginning when a file
changes.  With redo, you can just read the script from top to bottom.  A
`redo-ifchange` call is like calling a function, which you can also read
from top to bottom.)


# What projects use redo?

Here are a few open source examples:

* [Liberation Circuit](https://github.com/linleyh/liberation-circuit) is a
  straightforward example of a C++ binary (a game) compiled with redo.

* [WvStreams](https://github.com/apenwarr/wvstreams) uses a more complex
  setup producing several binaries, libraries, and scripts.  It shows how to
  produce output files in a different directory than the source files.

* [WvBuild](https://github.com/apenwarr/wvbuild) can cross-compile several
  dependencies, like openssl and zlib, and then builds WvStreams using those
  same libraries.  It's a good example of redo/make interop and complex
  dependencies.

* There's an experimental [variant of
  Buildroot](https://github.com/apenwarr/buildroot/tree/redo) that uses redo
  in order to clean up its dependency logic.

* You can also find some limited examples in the
  [`t/111-example/`](t/111-example) subdir of the redo project itself.

If you switch your program's build process to use redo, please let us know and
we can link to it here.

(Please don't use the code in the `t/` directory as serious examples of how
to use redo.  Many of the tests are doing things in deliberately psychotic
ways in order to stress redo's code and find bugs.)


# How does this redo compare to other redo implementations?

djb never released his version, so other people have implemented their own
variants based on his [published specification](http://cr.yp.to/redo.html).

This version, sometimes called apenwarr/redo, is probably the most advanced
one, including support for parallel builds, advanced build logs, and helpful
debugging features.  It's currently written in python for easier
experimentation, but the plan is to eventually migrate it to plain C.  (Some
people like to call this version "python-redo", but I don't like that name. 
We shouldn't have to rename it just because we port the code to C.)

Here are some other redo variants (thanks to Nils Dagsson Moskopp for many
of these links):

- Alan Grosskurth's [redo thesis](http://grosskurth.ca/papers/mmath-thesis.pdf)
  and related sh implementation.  (Arguably, this paper is the one that got
  all the rest of us started.)

- Nils Dagsson Moskopp's [redo-sh](https://web.archive.org/web/20181106195145/http://news.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/bin/redo-sh.html)
  is a completely self-sufficient sh-based implementation.

- apenwarr's [minimal/do](https://github.com/apenwarr/redo/blob/master/minimal/do)
  is included with this copy of redo.  It's also sh-based, but intended to
  be simple and failsafe, so it doesn't understand how to "redo" targets more
  than once.

- Christian Neukirchen's [redo-c](https://github.com/chneukirchen/redo-c), a
  C implementation.

- Jonathan de Boyne Pollard's [fork of Alan Grosskurth's redo](http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/redo/grosskurth-redo.html)
  (another sh-based implementation).

- Jonathan de Boyne Pollard's [redo](http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/redo/)
  rewritten in C++

- Gyepi Sam's [redux](https://github.com/gyepisam/redux) in Go

- jekor's [redo](https://github.com/jekor/redo) in Haskell

- Shanti Bouchez-Mongard√© (mildred)'s [fork of apenwarr's redo](https://github.com/mildred/redo)
  in python

- Tharre's [redo](https://github.com/Tharre/redo) in C

- catenate's [credo](https://github.com/catenate/credo), a (very
  rearchitected) variant written for the Inferno Shell.

The redo design is so simple and elegant that many individuals have been
inspired to (and able to) write their own version of it.  In the honoured
tradition of Unix's `make`, they (almost) all just use the same name,
`redo`.  Unfortunately, many of these
implementations are unmaintained, slightly incompatible with the "standard"
redo semantics, and/or have few or no automated tests.

At the time of this writing, none of them except apenwarr/redo (ie.  this
project) support parallel builds (`redo -j`).  For large projects,
parallel builds are usually essential.
