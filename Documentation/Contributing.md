# License

My version of redo was written without ever seeing redo code by Bernstein or
Grosskurth, so I own the entire copyright.  It's distributed under the GNU
LGPL version 2.  You can find a copy of it in the file called LICENSE.

minimal/do is in the public domain so that it's even easier
to include inside your own projects for people who don't
have a copy of redo.


# How can I help?

Nowadays, redo is good enough for real production use, and some people
are using it for real work.  That said, it has
not reached version 1.0 and there are surely still bugs.

If you run into a problem, it's really helpful if you report it to the
mailing list below (with or without subscribing first).  We really want to
know if redo is acting weird for you.  Even if the problem turns out to be
operator error, we can use that information to try to improve this
documentation.

Small feature additions are also welcome, but you might want to ask on the
mailing list before you start working on it.  The code is still evolving and
might not be the same by the time you submit your pull request.

The best things you can do for redo are:

- Convert your projects to using it.  Without users, no project is
  successful.

- Build new infrastructure around redo, especially things to make it easier
  for people to get started.  For example, an automake-like tool that filled
  in default redo build rules for common program types would probably be
  very popular.

- Convince your favourite OS distro to build and include (up to date!) redo
  packages.

- Tell your friends!

It might not look like it, but you can subscribe without having a

It's okay to send a message directly to the mailing list
without subscribing first.  If you reply to someone who writes to the
list, please leave them in the cc: list, since if they
